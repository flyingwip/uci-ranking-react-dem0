Self-Knowledge Questionnaire
Below the surface everyone is pretty complicated. Based on your answers, we think the following three traits are important strands in your personality:
REVERENCE

One part of you dreams of giving yourself up – perhaps just for a while – to a hero or mentor. In the right circumstances you can flourish by letting go of your ego. In your inner life, reverence plays out as a willing submission to your own conscience. In the outside world, you might get frustrated searching for something worth believing in – a country, a person, a company – but you will always be open to feeling respect, admiration and wonder. For Reverence:
On Devotion to Corporations
How to Serve
On the Longing for Authority
INDEPENDENCE

You don’t set out to be different for its own sake; you are more easily guided by what interests and moves you. You are more concerned about what is right for you than about the pressure to fit in. In sex you are more aware than others of impulses which are not entirely conventional. You know the value of selective irresponsibility, of forgetting occasionally about being ‘good’. For Independence:
How We Eat When No One is Looking
The Psychology of Cross-Dressing
The Entrepreneur and the Artists
SENSITIVITY

You have delicate, sensitive perceptions; you can be deeply moved by appearances – the right light in a room, or good food, or the texture of a piece of clothing. Expressive, intelligent language has a powerful hold on you; your mind works better when it is inspired and provoked by vivid imagery. It can be sad to live in a world which is often so ugly and not properly looked after. But you know that things can be otherwise, and you have the ability to appreciate the world at its best. For Sensitivity:
Why We Should Draw More
Why Design Matters
On Good and Bad Taste
